# JS Loops
This exercise includes looping through JS arrays using `For Loops`;


### What to do 
- Clone this repo and cd into this directory (`cd exercises/js-loops`).
- Open your `script.js`.
- Create an Array of family members including yourself. Be sure to include at least one young person under 21. You can use the array you wrote in the `js-vars` exercise.
- Give all people `name` and `age`, like I've given the `me` object.
- Loop through the array using a for loop.
- `console.log` all the family members name and age in one, like this: `Sina is 33 years old`.
- `console.log` whether or not each member of the family is old enough to drink or not, like this: `Sina is old enough to drink`.

### Bonus:
`console.log` who the oldest member of the family array is. Hint: This will require a global variable.

_GOOD LUCK!!!_
