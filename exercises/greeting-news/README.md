The end goal is also in this directory. It's called `end-goal.png`.


### What to do 
- Clone this repo.
- Navigate to the `exercises/greeting-news` directory.
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- Start by modifying the `index.html` and `style.css` in that directory.
- Add any CSS reset for the browser in `reset.css`, such as removing default margins for `body`, etc.
- I have included the background image in the `/assets` directory called `bg.jpg` but feel free to use any other background you like.
- Good luck!
