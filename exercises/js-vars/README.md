# JS Variables
This exercise includes building a robust, clean and easy to understand JavaScript variable.


### What to do 
- Create an HTML file, link it to a JS file like we did in class, called `script.js`. If you need help see the `js` directory in the root of this repo.
- Open your `script.js`
- Create an array
- The array must include all of your immediate family members
- Each member should have name, age, coder, relationship and another property of your own choosing
- Each family member must include a property called `children` in form of an array, except for mom and dad
- If you or any of your sublings have children, the `children` property should include objects representing each child
- Good luck!

### Bonus:
Create another array of your choosing, your favorite football team, your favorite restaurants in the city, whatever else you are into, and make sure each item in the array has at least 3 properties.
