# JS Age Comparison
This exercise includes building a function that compares the ages of two people and reports who is older.


### What to do
- Clone this repo and cd into this directory (`cd exercises/js-conditionals`)
- Open your `script.js`
- Create three object. One for you, one for your friend, one for your sibling. If you don't have a sibling create two friends
- Give all people `name` and `age`, like I've given the `me` object
- Call the `whoIsOlder` function 3 times, compared all three people (I have already added this on lines 12, 13 and 14)
- The `whoIsOlder` accepts 2 parameters, `person1` and `person2`. Add logic to this function so that it looks at the two persons' ages and `console.log` who is older.

### Bonus:
`console.log` what is the age difference is between the two persons.
