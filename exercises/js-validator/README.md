# JS Validator
This exercise includes building a function that validates the price of an item.


### Validation rules
The function should return:
- `Price cant be zero`, if the input is 0
- `Price cant be negative`, if the input is a negative number
- `Price is missing`, if the price is missing
- `Price is invalid`, if the price is the wrong type like string or boolean
- The price, if the price is valid!
